# hugoBlock
This will be a personal project working alongside with (Hugo)[https://github.com/Hugobsb] , but feel free to contribute with the project.

> this README will work as a to-do list inside the repository itself so you can see what we are currently working on.

**THIS IS NOT MENT TO BE A PROFESSIONAL BUILD THIS IS A STUDY BASED REPOSITORY**

### TO-DO LIST
- [ ] Structure and name the project
- [ ] Define block structure
- [ ] Implement block hashing
- [ ] Create the blockchain
- [ ] Implement Mining
- [ ] Handle transactions
- [ ] Implement consensus mechanism:
  -  Choose between proof-of-work and proof-of-stake
- [ ] Implement networking
  - (implement networking functionality to allow nodes to communicate with each other and synchronize their copies of the blockchain.)
- [ ] Testing 
- [ ] Documenting
- [ ] Deployment 
  - Choose between library or executable (document deployment process)
  
### Motivation of the project:

Pretty much we were on a discord call and Hugo turned to me and asked about how the bitcoin network worked, then, he asked me if it were possible to create a blockchain system from scratch in rust. And that is what we want to accomplish with this project.
